Put the wifi stuff in a folder, and then split the cgi and ssi stuff out
into more folder

Add a second checkbox, maybe choose between on, off or blinking
Use the RP2040s second core to process the blinking, I assume the web server 
is running on the main core, so you could do other stuff on the second core

Rename the repo
